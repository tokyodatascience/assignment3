Dear All,

As we discussed in some of our classes, we'll have an assignment involving translating code from TensorFlow to PyTorch. (Those of you who are in the 1 pm Japan time group will be asked to do this assignment later since we are just getting started and we have not covered the relevant material. But if you already have the relevant knowledge, I encourage you to submit the assignment by May 20.)

(1) Please take a look at the TensorFlow notebooks by Zaid Alyafeai:

https://github.com/zaidalyafeai/Notebooks

(2) Choose a notebook that interests you and that would be worth translating to PyTorch.

(3) Try to understand the syntax and the meaning of the code.

(4) Write equivalent code in PyTorch. Of course, you may need to look up a lot of syntax in the documentation.

(5) If you get stuck, please let us know! One of the purposes of this exercise is to identify things that are hard to understand. You can get individual help, and if the topic is general enough, we will discuss it in class.

(6) If you complete your PyTorch notebook and it works well, please submit the result. Besides the code, please also send a report in the PDF format describing how your work went, what was easy, what was difficult, and where you faced problems. Please also include any suggestions for improving the original TensorFlow notebook and/or for creating additional TensorFlow notebooks. Zaid told me that he would very much like to know. He is also interested in collaborating with our school in other ways.

(7) It would be great if you could then combine your notebooks and the PDF into one zip file and send it to me at fabinger@gmail.com by Monday, May 20.

Best,
Michal
